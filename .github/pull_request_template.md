## What's new? ##

- List your changes in a concise and clear way
- This will give the reviewers an idea of where to look for smelly code

### Visual aids ###

If there are visual changes include them here. You can add a screenshot or a recording using a tool like [this one](https://recordit.co/) and include it in the Pull Request.

This is the markdown to include an image in the pull request:

```md
![myimageurl.gif](myimageurl.gif);
```

You can include a comparison table as follows:

| Before | After   |
|---|---|
| Insert images from before the fix | Here is the after |
