[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/megsoft/EmpleaDo%20Build%20System/_apis/build/status/Emplea.Do%20Beta/beta.emplea.do%20-%20PR%20Builds?branchName=development)](https://dev.azure.com/megsoft/EmpleaDo%20Build%20System/_build/latest?definitionId=26&branchName=development)

## Getting the project up and running

### Install the following software

- [.NET SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/vs/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Running the app for the first time

0. Run the script (init.sh or init.bat), this will install all command line tools, and it will initialize and setup the [database](docs/Database.md)
1. Open the solution
2. Restore the nuget packages
3. Run the Web project

This project has two initializations for Windows and for Linux or Mac

## Workflow

0. Review the list of issues and pick the one you like.
1. Check if the issue has been assigned to someone.
2. Ask for the issue to be assigned to you with a comment.
3. Create a feature branch in your repo in the following format **feature/{issue_number}-simple-title**.
4. Work iteratively and commit often.
5. Ask for help when needed. If run into any impediment air it out in slack or comment in your issue,
6. Prepare the Pull Request following [the guidelines](https://github.com/developersdo/emplea_do/blob/development/.github/pull_request_template.md).

### JS libraries and libman

This project includes some third party js libraries, they have been included in the repo because they are integral for the correct workings of the theme we picked.
If you need to add another third party library make sure to do it using the [LibMan CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/libman/libman-cli?view=aspnetcore-2.2#installation).
It gets installed when you run the `init.sh` script.

### Configuring Authentication

Rename the `appsetting.template.json` file to `appsetting.json` and complete the client ids and secrets for each authentication provider you want to use.

You can see a [step-by-step guide](docs/Authentication.md) of how to do it.

### Configure Database

Replace the password for the database in the files `docker.sh` or `docker.bat` and `init.sh` or `init.bat` accordingly to your OS.

You can find more information [here](docs/Database.md) about the database.

#### Ignoring changes of the appsettings file

To ignore changes made to the `appsettings.Development.json` file run the following

```sh
git update-index --assume-unchanged Web/appsettings.Development.json
```

The `init.sh` does this automatically.

## In case of connection issues

If you happen to run to the following error while running for the first time, something about database connection issue: [SQLite Error 14: 'unable to open database file']. Try Setting the connection string to use the full path location of the `mydb.db` file.

Example:`"Data Source=C:\\CODE\\emplea_do\\mydb.db;"`

## Slack Configuration

To configure your own slackservice just follow the [Official](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#getting_started) to get started. After you completed slack configuration, you should have a **token** and a **workspace section**, with a Webhook URL that'll look something like this `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`, you should only be interested in `T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` (because that is what we are going to use in the appsetting).

Now add your **token** with key `"slackVerificationToken"` and **workspace section** with key `"slackWebhookEndpoint"` in `appsettings.json`.

## If you have any questions or just want to hang out

- We have a [slack channel](https://empleado-slack.azurewebsites.net)
