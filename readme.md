### JS libraries and libman ###

This project includes some third party js libraries, they have been included in the repo because they are integral for the correct workings of the theme we picked.
If you need to add another third party library make sure to do it using the [LibMan CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/libman/libman-cli?view=aspnetcore-2.2#installation). 
It gets installed when you run the `init.sh` script.

### Configuring Authentication ###

Rename the `appsetting.template.json` file to `appsetting.json` and complete the client ids and secrets for each authentication provider you want to use.

#### Ignoring changes of the appsettings file ####

To ignore changes made to the `appsettings.Development.json` file run the following

```sh
git update-index --assume-unchanged Web/appsettings.Development.json
```

The `init.sh` does this automatically.
